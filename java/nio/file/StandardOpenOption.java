     * specified. In particular, an implementation may be unable to guarantee
     * that it deletes the expected file when replaced by an attacker while the
     * file is open. Consequently, security sensitive applications should take
     * care when using this option.

     * LinkOption#NOFOLLOW_LINKS} option. In other words, if the option is present
